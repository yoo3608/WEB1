<p>Today W3C released to the public the April 2021 edition of our W3C Strategic Highlights which documents the tremendous work to enhance, grow and strengthen the Web platform, and how the Web Consortium meets the needs of industry and society as a whole. At the same time, as we celebrate the anniversary of the release of the World Wide Web into the public domain on 30 April 1993 by CERN, our CEO Jeff Jaffe has published his reflections on the centrality of the Web Consortium as the Web has been accelerating to meet society’s needs, and on the importance of the Web infrastructure in the modern world. Human civilization is at an extraordinary juncture. The Web Consortium is in an incredible position to host the open forum where diverse voices from different parts of the world come together to incubate and build the global standards for the Web in the 25 years to come.</p>
